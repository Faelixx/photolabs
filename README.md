# Photolabs

Photolabs is a react based project that allows users to browse different photos from different catagories.

## Description

Photolabs is a single page web application, using a modal to show users more information about a clicked photo along with, other related images.

Users have the capability to like any of the photos. Once a photo has been liked, the photo will be marked with a filled heart and a notification will appear in the top navigation bar of the app.

Sort through photos based on the provided topics in the top navigation bar.

<em>Note: Users cannot upload to the app, it is only meant for browsing.</em>
